    "S1S1_1": "Hello my friend! Are you %{name}?",
    "S1S1_3": "I am the King’s messenger,. We have a mission for you. He has heard that you are the best craftsman in the kingdom and you find great solutions to any kind of problem. Is this true?",
    "S1S1_5": "Don’t be so humble. If that is true, then grab your stuff and come with me to Lalandia Royal City, Empatheia!",
    "S1S1_2": "Yes, I am.",
    "S1S1_4": "Well, I try my best.",

    "S1S2_1": "Ah! I’m happy you accepted my invitation. I am the king of Lalandia. I need a new carriage to travel throughout the kingdom. And I have been told you are the best craftsman/designer in the whole kingdom. So my mission, if you accept it, is to build for me the best carriage in the world.",
    "S1S2_3": "Yes, yes. It needs to be all that. And we need it within 6 months.  We will be going to the Great Kings` Council where all the Kings of the North are meeting. Now, do you accept?",
    "S1S2_5": "Lad, you know them all. We’ve just told them to you. Now go! The queen and I are hosting the Prince from The Southern Sea so we have no time to discuss it further more. Good luck!",
    "S1S2_4": "My queen, my king, it would be an honor to accept this challenging mission. I therefore accept it. In order to design this carriage I have many questions to ask you so that I understand what you need.",
    "S1S2_6": "But what kind of carriage shall I design? What shall be the different functions of it? I have no clue of what the king and queen really need. This is all so blurry.",
    "S1S2_2": "I am the queen of Lalandia. I will also be using this new carriage to go around the kingdom. I need both a practical carriage but also surely the most beautiful one in the world.",

    "S1S3_1": "What exactly is the best-practical-good-looking carriage in the world? You will enter a world full of characters that will tell you different opinions about what they think this carriage should be like.",
    "S1S3_2": "You seem quite lost my boy/girl.",
    "S1S3_3": "Well, I am a bit. The king and queen just gave me the mission of building a new carriage for them. But I need more information so that I can design it properly. What do they need it for ? What shall it do ? On what types of road do they usually travel ? How big should it be ? What should be the functions of it ? They remained very blurry with their order.",

    "S1S3_4": "My friend, you have to build a strong and truly resistant carriage! It should be safe for the royal family to travel in it. And no need for fancyness, there is beauty in roughness.",
    "S1S4_1": "Long journeys can be exhausting. The carriage needs to be comfortable. And I'm not saying that only for me but also for the royal couple!",
    "S1S4_2": "The carriage should be the richest one ever made in the kingdom in order to show the power of the king and wealth of its land, it should be a piece of art and luxury.",
    "S1S4_3": "The royal family has a lot of stuff to carry around, clothes, gifts, etc. So I need space to put all that in the carriage",
    "S1S4_4": "Think about the horses who will drag the carriage. If you want to go fast, you have to be small and light. Otherwise they'll get exhausted very quickly.",
    "S1S4_5": "It would be great if the carriage could fit some of my medical instruments and drugs. I could have everything at my disposal in case of need",
    "S1S4_6": "The royal couple has to eat but can choose to stay in his other palaces or in guest´s houses. No need for an on-board mini kitchen.",
    "S1S4_7": "The carriage should be light and efficient. You are not building a tower that has to stand for centuries but a traveling cart. Make it light and agile.",
    "S1S4_8": "Time is money my friend. A king and a queen have no time to waste wandering around. Just make it fast.",
    "S1S4_9": "Make that carriage comfortable because the cobble stones here are very hard... and the king and queen's butts will hurt pretty bad... I can assure you that",
    "S1S4_10": "The carriage must be reflecting the importance of the role of the king throughout the world and the history of the kingdom and therefore be symbolically loaded with historical symbols, the carriage should become a legendary artefact.",
    "S1S4_11": "Get out of my way, lad, there are some people working here!",
    "S1S4_12": "Don't let the royal family ruin the kingdom with this carriage. They already have much more than what we, the people, have. Make it simple.",
    "S1S4_13": "He who would travel happily must travel light.",
    "S1S4_14": "I have no time to discuss. I have meat to catch.",

    "S1S5_1": "Now that you have gathered enough opinions you may return to your workshop to start working on the carriage project or continue meeting with other people.",

    "S2S0": "Welcome back to your workshop! Based on what you have heard it is now time to make some choices about what type of carriage you are thinking would best fit the needs of the King and the Queen.",
    "S2S1": "My friend, it seems you have taken no real decisions. A medium carriage will not fit the needs of the King and the Queen. Make real choices.",
    "S2S2": "What a promising carriage! Well done!",

    "S3S1_2": "The carriage of Queen Patricia is the fastest one within the kingdom but often fails and breaks.",
    "S3S1_3": "The carriage of Queen Mihaela is the most beautiful one but not so convenient, slightly heavy and a nightmare to clean (the mud gets stuck in all the decorative elements of the outer walls).",
    "S3S1_4": "The carriage of King Pablo is the strongest one within the kingdom. It survived to all bad roads and even to many attacks but it slow and heavy.",
    "S3S1_5": "The carriage of Queen Ana is the most comfortable one. Even the seat for the coachman is made of very soft and comfy materials. It makes every journey very pleasant.",
    "S3S1_6": "The carriage of King Tharrenos is the one with the largest storage. It offers a great space. Traveling with it is almost like carrying your house around.",

    "S3S3_1": "I hope this little tour of the carriages of other kings and queens have inspired you. Now let’s go on with ours!",

    "S5S0_1": "Now that your prototype is ready, let’s show it to some people to see what they think of it before presenting it to the king.",
    "S5S1_1": "Well, it seems quite strong to me. We should try it before giving it to the king and queen.",
    "S5S1_2": "Well done. My friend. That's quite a nice carriage. But do you think it can pass through narrow streets? You should try before delivering it.",
    "S5S1_3": "Not bad. Not bad, at all I would say. But do you think it is fancy enough if the royal couple has to go to a ceremony? You should ask what people think about it before handing it over to the king and queen.",
    "S5S1_4": "Sorry lad, no time to chat.",
    "S5S1_5": "I have work to do. Ask someone else.",
    "S5S1_6": "Hum ?",
    "S5S1_7": "Based on the feedback you just received, do you wish to review your design or ignore their feedback and keep your design as it is?",

    "S5S2_1": "You are now ready for the real world test. Are you ready to see if your carriage is good enough now? You’re taking the carriage out and encounter and stop at a crossroad. There are 3 paths you may choose from. Pick one of the 3 paths.",
    "stage5_disruptions_narrator_d2": "New options have just appeared in your workshop, go back to it to discover them.",
    "stage5_disruptions_narrator_d3": "Now that you have augmented your carriage, take it out for a new test.",

    "S5S2_4": "You have now chosen to surround your carriage with soldiers and weapons to go through the war time! What is good is that you don’t have to change anything about the design of your carriage. This allows you to respond temporarily to this exceptional need with little effort. Well done!",
    "S5S2_3": "You have now chosen to design the carriage for sharing! Congratulations! Most carriages are parked for 80% of their time, so sharing is caring. Remember to also think about how to divide the time of use of the carriage. Ask a parent/teacher to show you how to design a sharing scheme for both the royal family and their neighbours/friends...",
    "S5S2_2": "You have now chosen to surround your carriage with entertainers (musicians, artists, soldiers), flags and fancy animals elephants/giraffe/camel/ostrich, to go to the congress of kings and queens! What is good is that this does not impact the design of your carriage but allows you to respond temporarily to this exceptional need of showing off. Well done!",

    "S6S1_1": "It’s the day we have been waiting for! It is time we present our carriage to the King and the Queen.",
    "S6S1_2": "Well done! You have done a fantastic job. I am very happy with it.",
    "stage6_main_character_d1" : "Thank you, my queen! I really enjoyed working with this! And had lots of other ideas while trying to design the best carriage, perhaps some would be useful to you?",
    "stage6_ending_queen_d2": "Go ahead!",
    "stage6_main_character_d2" : "Well, perhaps you could make the carriage more...",

    "stage6_ending_king_d1": "Do you have any suggestion for me?",

    "S6S1_3": "Yes! That carriage is perfect!",

    "stage6_scene1_dseat": "environmentally friendly and design the carriage for sharing by making it bigger ! Most carriages are parked for 80% of their time, so sharing is caring",
    "stage6_scene1_shield": "robust, by fitting it for war. Thicker walls won’t be enough, you need to surround your carriage with soldiers and shields/pikes attached to the walls. It will surely impress your possible attackers.",
    "stage6_scene1_entertainers": "even more beautiful by surrounding your carriage with entertainers (musicians, artists, soldiers), flags and fancy animals elephants/giraffe/camel/ostrich, to go to the congress of kings and queens! I bet everybody will be very impressed.",
    
    "S6S2_1": "Thank you so much but could you make it pink?",
    "S6S2_2": "I love it but could you make it rainbow?",
    "S6S2_3": "It’s an amazing carriage but could you make it with wings?",
    "S6S2_4": "I like it very much but could you cover it with feathers?",

    "S6S3_1": "My friend you have done an incredible work! This is a masterpiece! You can be proud of yourself. The whole kingdom is thankful. I don't know what's your plans for the future, but don't loose that creativity of yours!",

    "S4S1_1": "With all the information you gathered from the people you've met with, the existing carriages you've seen and your own point of view and intuition, it is now time to start prototyping the carriage.",

    "S4S2_1": "Your carriage is too cheap. You are building the royal family's carriage! Not a merchant's cart!",
    "S4S2_7": "You are ruining the kingdom !  Reconsider your design by choosing less expensive elements.",

    "S4S2_2": "Your carraige is so simple that it will only take a couple of weeks to build it. We can invest more time as we have 6 months to deliver it. Let's improve our carriage",
    "S4S2_8": "The royal family needs the carriage to be ready in 6 months. Choose some more simple elements to reduce the building time.",

    "S4S2_3": "Your carriage is way too heavy and slow. Journeys will take forever",

    "S4S2_4": "You carriage is too rough for a royal carriage, it looks like a peasant's carriage",

    "S4S2_5": "You have to make a carriage not a chariot. Make it more convenient!",

    "S4S2_6": "Your carriage is way too fragile as it is built. It will break apart at the first cobble stone it will hit",
