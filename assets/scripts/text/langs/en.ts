    "stage1_scene1_messenger_d1": "Hello my friend! Are you %{name}?",
    "stage1_scene1_messenger_d2": "I am the King’s messenger,. We have a mission for you. He has heard that you are the best craftsman in the kingdom and you find great solutions to any kind of problem. Is this true?",
    "stage1_scene1_messenger_d3": "Don’t be so humble. If that is true, then grab your stuff and come with me to Lalandia Royal City, Empatheia!",
    "stage1_scene1_player_d1": "Yes, I am.",
    "stage1_scene1_player_d2": "Well, I try my best.",

    "stage1_scene2_king_d1": "Ah! I’m happy you accepted my invitation. I am the king of Lalandia. I need a new carriage to travel throughout the kingdom. And I have been told you are the best craftsman/designer in the whole kingdom. So my mission, if you accept it, is to build for me the best carriage in the world.",
    "stage1_scene2_king_d2": "Yes, yes. It needs to be all that. And we need it within 6 months.  We will be going to the Great Kings` Council where all the Kings of the North are meeting. Now, do you accept?",
    "stage1_scene2_king_d3": "Lad, you know them all. We’ve just told them to you. Now go! The queen and I are hosting the Prince from The Southern Sea so we have no time to discuss it further more. Good luck!",
    "stage1_scene2_player_d1": "My queen, my king, it would be an honor to accept this challenging mission. I therefore accept it. In order to design this carriage I have many questions to ask you so that I understand what you need.",
    "stage1_scene2_player_d2": "But what kind of carriage shall I design ? What shall be the different functions of it ? I have no clue of what the king and queen really need. This is all so blurry.",
    "stage1_scene2_queen_d1": "I am the queen of Empatheia. I will also be using this new carriage to go around the kingdom. I need both a practical carriage but also surely the most beautiful one in the world.",

    "stage1_scene3_narrator_d1": "What exactly is the best-practical-good-looking carriage in the world? You will enter a world full of characters that will tell you different opinions about what they think this carriage should be like.",
    "stage1_scene3_kings_captain_d1": "You seem quite lost my boy/girl.",
    "stage1_scene3_kings_player_d1": "Well, I am a bit. The king and queen just gave me the mission of building a new carriage for them. But I need more information so that I can design it properly. What do they need it for ? What shall it do ? On what types of road do they usually travel ? How big should it be ? What should be the functions of it ? They remained very blurry with their order.",

    "stage1_scene4_captain_d1": "My friend, you have to build a strong and truly resistant carriage! It should be safe for the royal family to travel in it. And no need for fancyness, there is beauty in roughness.",
    "stage1_scene4_coachman_male_d1": "Long journeys can be exhausting. The carriage needs to be comfortable. And I'm not saying that only for me but also for the royal couple!",
    "stage1_scene4_tailor_female_d1": "The carriage should be the richest one ever made in the kingdom in order to show the power of the king and wealth of its land, it should be a piece of art and luxury.",
    "stage1_scene4_butler_male_d1": "The royal family has a lot of stuff to carry around, clothes, gifts, etc. So I need space to put all that in the carriage",
    "stage1_scene4_stable_boy_d1": "Think about the horses who will drag the carriage. If you want to go fast, you have to be small and light. Otherwise they'll get exhausted very quickly.",
    "stage1_scene4_doctor_male_d1": "It would be great if the carriage could fit some of my medical instruments and drugs. I could have everything at my disposal in case of need",
    "stage1_scene4_chef_female_d1": "The royal couple has to eat but can choose to stay in his other palaces or in guest´s houses. No need for an on-board mini kitchen.",
    "stage1_scene4_civil_engineer_female_d1": "The carriage should be light and efficient. You are not building a tower that has to stand for centuries but a traveling cart. Make it light and agile.",
    "stage1_scene4_merchant_male_d1": "Time is money my friend. A king and a queen have no time to waste wandering around. Just make it fast.",
    "stage1_scene4_old_lady_female_d1": "Make that carriage comfortable because the cobble stones here are very hard... and the king and queen's butts will hurt pretty bad... I can assure you that",
    "stage1_scene4_librarian_female_d1": "The carriage must be reflecting the importance of the role of the king throughout the world and the history of the kingdom and therefore be symbolically loaded with historical symbols, the carriage should become a legendary artefact.",
    "stage1_scene4_stage1_scene4_butcher_male_d1": "Get out of my way, lad, there are some people working here!",
    "potter_female_d1": "Don't let the royal family ruin the kingdom with this carriage. They already have much more than what we, the people, have. Make it simple.",
    "stage1_scene4_vagabond_male_d1": "He who would travel happily must travel light.",
    "stage1_scene4_huntress_female_d1": "I have no time to discuss. I have meat to catch."
